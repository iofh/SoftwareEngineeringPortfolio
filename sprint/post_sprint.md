# Overall Sprint

Here are the achievements that i think i achieved overall in the project.

## Professional achievement
---

#### Project Management

We used KANBAN for our project. We also used user stories to guide us. I also updated the KANBAN frequently.

#### Translation
With Sen and Frederic, their language skills are not as good compared to other students. I understand Chinese so when they could not express some words i would help them translate it so they could get the message across. 

There are multiple occasions that they misunderstood what the customer wants during our meeting. So after the meeting i brief through what the customer wants in Chinese so they could have a better understanding.

#### Teamwork
I help guide my teammates with their tasks. I help them when they are stuck on anything from programming to translation. I could not give many solid evidence that i help them with their programming. But i can assure that i spend most of my time helping them after i finish my task. And i am happy that i experience working in a team. 

#### Leadership

Having more programming experience, I help my team divide up the task in every sprint. This is because i know each of their individual ability and i can assign task that is challenging enough and yet not too hard to them. 

Fluent with 2 languages, I also did some explaining and translation when communicating either with the client and with Alister(our only English speaker teammates).
