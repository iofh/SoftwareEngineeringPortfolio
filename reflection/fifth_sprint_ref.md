# Fifth Sprint

## What went well

I managed to get my task done before the meeting with our client. With extra time, i am able to help my teammates with their task. I am able to help Frederic with his task on letting the user join a group which he did not manage to finish in the previous sprint. With me helping Frederic, we manage to get all the important functionality done for the client.


__Commit Messages__: Overall i think most of my commit messages are very clear. However there are some that are long and undescriptive. I still have room to improve on my commit messages.

## What needs to be improved

### Commits messages
My commit messages is sometimes long and sometimes undescriptive. This is why i think i need to improve my commits messages. 

I will learn from some resource to improve on my commit messages. Those resources would be [1](https://www.theserverside.com/video/Follow-these-git-commit-message-guidelines) [2](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) [3](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53)


### Designing
My sense of design is really bad. It is quite late to redesigning our website. Using this [website](https://uxgorilla.com/nielsens-heuristics/) and [this](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) about Heuristics, i might be able to improve my UX senses. 

## What lesson did I learn

Since this is the last sprint, the lesson i learnt is that there is too much to learn. And this project has only scratch the surface of being a full stack developer. Using laravel is relatively easy compare to using pure php. 
There is no way for us to be fluent in php in just 20+ weeks. That's why using agile principle. 

    Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

We used other people's code to help us build our own project. It makes everything more efficient. As long as the customer is satisfied with the developer producing working software. It does not matter whether you are writing the whole project in pure php or using laravel. 

Over the whole project. I learnt how to work in a team and i learnt how to deal with teammates not doing their task in time and how to deal with it. I also learnt how scrum and agile help me during the project. For example, with the daily scrum meeting. I am able to know where our group stands in term of progress in a sprint. If one teammate needs help, i am able to know it when they mention it during the scrum meeting.

## What barriers did i encounter

Barriers encountered in this sprint are not technical barriers. 

### Insufficient time for helping teammates with their task

During the this sprint and the previous one. Our task gets more and more technical. Some task requires more technical skills to complete. Some of my teammates lack the skills to complete some fo their task. Therefore, when they asked for assistance i do not have enough time to help them with everything. I would be able to help them more if i do not have other papers/subjects to take care of. Although i know it's partially my fault for not managing my time well enough. However, i think i need to let my teammates be more independent. Instead of asking for help, they will google the problem and solve it themselves. It might lead to our project being not as good compared to the other group in the short term. But in the long term, i think leaving them to figure out problems is the best way to help them improve.
