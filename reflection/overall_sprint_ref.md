# Overall Sprint

## What went well

Our project went good but i would like it to be better. Many of our UI and UX is not good enough in my opinion. I wanted to do more to improve those things. However, with time constraints, my teammate needing help from me and doing other papers assignments. I am not able to do the things i wanted.

## What needs to be improved

#### Everything

As i said in the fifth sprint reflection. I learnt that there is too much to learn. And everything needs to be improved. My professional skills and technical skills is not good enough in my opinion. I will keep on learning on how to become a better software engineer and also improve my communication skills.

#### GIT commit frequency

Over the whole project, my commits is not that frequent. I usually commit after everything is done. For example, when i worked on a function that allows a user to add games. I did not commit straight ahead. Instead, i continue to work on other functions such as login/register and also work on some html. After i finished those functionalities, only then i decided to commit

This lead to me unable to have a good summary of what i did in my commit messages. My commit messages would be "added games function and login". I had left out the register function and the html part. 

This is why when i went back to the commits and find one of the functionality. I always spend way too long finding the code because i did not describe what i did in the commit message.

#### My willingness to help my teammates

At first it was easy to help my teammates with their task. Since it was relatively easy. However, nearing the end of the project everything gets harder and my teammates require more and more help. I always hesitate to help them because i do not enough time. However, looking at the other team (EG: Mikrosoft) i saw that Isaac frequently help his teammates and their end project is better than ours. 

Although, it is too late to help them now since the sprints are over. I did know what i need to improve on. The thing i need to improve on the most is my attitude and my mindset. I need to be a team person. Only then i can succeed in the IT industry.

### What lesson did I learn

I learnt to be customer centric using all the 12 agile principles and the 4 agile values and it helps me grow as an IT person. 

I also learnt how to use the MVC framework by using laravel.

I also used scrum framework to helping keep in track of our project. EG: using sprint backlog, user stories and standup meetings.

I learnt how to properly use github workflow. For example, how to use a branch how to rollback a commit and how to deal with merge conflicts.

I also learnt how security is important to our website. For example, this [commit](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-sw602/commit/afe358a93e5b346116b170524cb7376a2b781f65) by Sen where our .env is visible to the internet. And also the problem we had in the final sprint where our mariadb server has the wrong permission and our database password is shown on the error page.
