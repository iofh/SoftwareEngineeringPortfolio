# First Sprint

## What went well

Everything went smoothly in the first sprint. Everyone managed to finish their task before the end of the sprint. I have good communication with my team members, but there is more that could improve on. I understand the basics of using the laravel framework. 


## What needs to be improved

#### Communication With Teammates

I took the task of doing the register/login account without discussing with my teammates.

I should communicate more with my teammates, so that everyone knows who should be responsible for which task.

#### Unfamiliar with laravel blade template and MVC (Model, View, Controller) framework

All the task in the first sprint is relatively  easy to do. Using the online [tutorial](https://morioh.com/p/9b8c8ef67bd5/laravel-5-8-tutorial-from-scratch-for-beginners), some copy pasting and changing a few words. We manage to finish the sprint. However, I would assume that further sprint will get even more complicated. Copy-pasting other people's code will not work by then. 

In the next sprint, i should take my time and understand more on laravel blade template and MVC framework. 

#### Scrum meetings /  standup meetings

We did not do much standup meeting for the first sprint. Therefore, i need to initialize first and gather them together and do a stand up meeting regularly.

### What lesson did I learn

I learnt how to use laravel blade template and i learnt more about the MVC framework. I understand how the view needs to talk to the controller to know what needs to be showed and what each button do. 

I also learnt how to use the scrum framework. For example, our team need to set up a backlog every sprint and after the end of the sprint we need to do a sprint retrospective to reflect on ourselves. We also need to do frequent stand up meetings to keep ourselves in track.

I learnt how to use user stories to help us make sure that we are on the same page as the client. User stories lets us know what the client expect and what we should do to fulfil the customers' needs. 

Our userstories can be found [here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-sw602/issues).

### What barriers did i encounter

The first sprint is relatively straight forward. However, the only encounter was following the laravel tutorial which is a step up since i had never encounter the MVC framework before. But overall, not many barriers were encountered.
