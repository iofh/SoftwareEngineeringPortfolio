## Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

There are many ways to produce a website. We decided to use laravel to produce the website instead of doing it in pure php. 

    "Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex, intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior." 

    A quote from Dee Hock, former CEO of Visa International. 

With laravel's simple blade template. And also their documentation. It is far easier to learn than doing everything from scratch. For example, learning how to migrate database in SQL would take up more time than just learning how to type in php artisan migrate on laravel. 

This gives evidence that we use a simple, pre-made tool to help us with our project. Which maximize our efficiency and save us a lot of time.
