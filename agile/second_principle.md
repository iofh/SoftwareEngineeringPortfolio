## Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customerâ€™s competitive advantage.

In the sprint 3 meeting with the client. The client said he does not need a profile for the account. However, during the middle sprint 4 meeting. He decided that he wants the profile page. Our team welcome the changes, even though we are halfway through the sprint 4. 

Although the changes are sudden, we gave what the customer wants. This is because having the profile page might be the function that lets our customer gain the competitive edge.

Another evidence that we welcomed changes is when the customer wanted us to sort the games/user/scores on the homepage of the website. At first, the customer only wanted us to show those 3 things(games/user/scores) without any sorting. But during the 4th sprint, our customer changed his mind and requested us to make the changes. We granted his request by the games/user/scores.

Nearing the end of our project. The customer also requested that we only limit our data shown on the homepage. He wanted us to show only 5 games,5 scores and 5 users on the homepage. We manage to get it done and let our client review it.

Overall, we as an agile team needs to be customer centric. Anything that the customer wants, we need to fulfil the customers' needs. So that our customer will have a competitive advantage against other competitors. We respond to changes instead of following a plan.

According to ROBBRECHT VAN AMERONGEN in this [article](https://technology.amis.nl/2007/08/24/agile-software-development-the-principles-2-welcome-change/)

    "Business is changing. Business changes do not hold during the execution of the project. To keep an competitive advantage it is hardly possible to allow no changes during projects with medium to long time span. New markets are explored; customers demand changing service and competitors deliver new products/services."

If we want to succeed in being a software engineer. We need to be able to satisfy the customer and help the customer gain the competitive edge. We did this by changing our code to meets the customer's needs.
