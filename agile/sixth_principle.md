## The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
---

First Day of our meeting, We met up with our client, and show our user stories. Our client gave feedback straight away and we notice that some of our user stories are not specific enough. Instead of exchanging email back and forward. We communicate face-to-face directly, this saved us plenty  of time to think of ways to reword our user stories instead of spending time exchanging emails.

Every two weeks, we meet our client face to face to discuss on the progress of the project. We agreed that it must be face to face because information might be harder to be conveyed in emails. Only minor question will be asked using Microsoft teams and emails. All the major decision making and project reviews are all done face to face with the client.

    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

With face to face meeting, we are able to fulfil this agile value. We value individual and interactions more than processes and tools. We meet up with the client and talk about the project instead of writing a report every sprint and send the report to the client through email.

There are alot of distraction if we use email to communicate with each other. One might not be able to express themselves well enough through email. Additionally, it takes up too much time to send email back and forth. Therfore, face to face conversation is the best way to communicate.
