## Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

---

_31th July 2019_ 
Our team as a developer asked our clients to give feedback on our user's stories which we wrote on the 29th July. Some user stories that do not match what the clients wanted and through today's feedback, we knew which users' stories to keep and which not to keep.

The figure above shows the user stories that the clients somewhat agreed on. But there is still some uncertainty in our user stories. Therefore, more interview or meetings will be held to make sure that we and developers make a software which matches the clients' needs. 
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project:  

The meeting/conversation with the client today provides evidence that our team(the developer) and Martin (the client) work together to progress in this project by letting the client review/ give feedback for our user stories 

This image shows us deleting the not important user stories after our meeting with the client.

Our team also set up a recurring meeting with the client every 2 weeks. We wanted to show the client what we did after every sprint and receive feedback from the client. We value __customer collaboration over contract negotiation__

"Many folks want to buy software the way they buy a car. They have a list of features in mind, they negotiate a price, and they pay for what they asked for." 
([Fowler & Highsmith 2001](http://users.jyu.fi/~mieijala/kandimateriaali/Agile-Manifesto.pdf)) 

Following the quote, most of software's production doesn't work like that. We could not see what the future might hold. If our client wants us to plan a website and build our website according to the plan. When the time comes to show our finished website. It might not be the same website that the customer needs at that time. This is why the client and the developer must work together daily. So that money and time won't be wasted.

Therefore, our team use this principle frequently as we are always in contact with our client and we always do a face to face meeting with our client every 2 weeks.
