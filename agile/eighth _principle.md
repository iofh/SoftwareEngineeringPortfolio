## Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

While creating our website. Every sprint we maintain a constant pace. We did what the customer wants and deliver what the customer needs. We maintain this pace for the whole software engineering course. 

At first, we are not very familiar with laravel. Therefore our first sprint is doing something relatively easy. However, after the second/third sprint. Our pace increase, we manage to get a more difficult task done. For example, banning user with third party. 

We also did not force ourself too much by cramming too much task in one sprint. We learnt from our previous sprint. If the sprint workload is too much, we tone it down in the next sprint. If it is too less, then we bump it up. 

In the second sprint, we did insufficient tasks.

 So in the third and fourth sprint, we did a lot and we overwhelmed ourself

In the fifth sprint, we tone it down and make our sprint more manageable.

Being agile means people need to be alert and creative and can maintain the alertness and creativity for the full length of the software development ([Fowler & Highsmith 2001](http://users.jyu.fi/~mieijala/kandimateriaali/Agile-Manifesto.pdf)) 

It is not sustainable if we cramp too much task in one sprint. It might look like we are progressing well, but in actual fact, we are falling behind because we could not maintain the pace that we set for ourself. 

It all comes down like a marathon. You can sprint very fast in the first few kilometres but for the rest of the marathon, you are too tired to sprint. Maintaining constant pace is the key to being agile.
