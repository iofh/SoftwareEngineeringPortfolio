## Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

On 7/08/2019, My teammate, Sen Li had not finished the laravel tutorial and is stuck on a certain point. With agile principle number 5, i know that helping a teammate will give them a good environment to work in and will motivate them to do a better job. Therefore, i did not hesitate to help Sen on his laravel tutorial. It is a win-win situation where i get to improve my understanding of laravel by helping Sen. While Sen gets to know how to set up laravel properly.

On 23/08/2019 Dale's day, no class is held on this day. But i l came to school to finish up our project. Sen and Fredric came along to do their individual task as well. I help them with their individual task. They are motivated and i wanted to give support to them when they are stuck. I explained clearly what a route does, what a controller does, how the controller shows the view on the webpage. I wanted to let them know the basics before we get into a more harder task. 

Giving support from the start will improve my teammates' knowledge. This will have a positive effect on our team in the long run. For example, finishing our individual task quickly without having issues. And provide continuous delivery of valuable software to our client.

This also proves that we are very motivated individuals as we came in to do our project even though its a school holiday.

On 28/08/2019, In class, we are taught how to use migration script to create table, update/delete columns in table without losing any of our data. 

I notice Sen is having difficulties catching up with what martin is saying, I provided my assistant to Sen by telling him the things that he missed. I helped a little bit with Fredric as well. 

I wanted to help them because we as a team needed knowledge about migration script to properly use the database. If one of us mess something up or have insufficient knowledge on migration script. We could lose important data in our database.

I also find it easier to help Sen and Fredric using Chinese. Sometimes they will miss some instruction or do not understand something in english and i will help them by translating it to Chinese. Easy communication between teammates will help us improve and make our project get done quicker.

Overall, i helped out Frederic and Sen and sometimes Alister with their individual task. I helped Frederic and Sen a bit more as i think they require the help the most in the team. 

Me using chinese to explain to Frederic and Sen really helps the project grows. When the lecturer or the client speak too quickly, i can recap everything and explain to them in chinese. This is the evidence that i used this agile principle to give support to my teammates.

After reading this [article](https://expertprogrammanagement.com/2018/04/herzbergs-two-factor-theory/). I understand how to motivate my teammates. Which can relate to this agile as giving my teammates a good environment to work in will have a positive effect on our project.

Herzbergâ€™s Motivation Theory has two factor.

Motivators: I give my teammates some responsibility and also give them recognition of the work they done.

Hygine Factors: Although this is hard to apply to our project, because we are not doing this project for money. However, if it is with monetary purpose. I will definitely reward my teammates for the ammount of work they done.
