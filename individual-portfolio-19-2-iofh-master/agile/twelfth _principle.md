## At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

After the first sprint, we sat down and discuss what needs to be improved. Firstly we talk about how we should divide our task more properly next time. For example, instead of having one person working on one user story. We should work on a user story together and divide our task base on the Model, View, Controller framework.

We also talk about how we should communicate more. In the first sprint. Since it is relatively easy, we just went off and did our individual task without communicating with each other.

### Scrum Framework

We utilized the scrum framework to manage our team.

#### Regular Scrum Meeting
With regular scrum/stand up meeting. We as a team know our progress in the project and we are able to reflect on what we did in the previous sprint and improve it in our next sprint. Example of this would be shown in our [sprint retrospective](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-sw602/projects). We as a team reflect on our performance every 2 weeks and set our target for the next sprint.

The pictures below shows some picture taken during the standup meetings / regular meetings.

### GITHUB's KANBAN

We also utilized github's KANBAN to help us know our progress in each sprint. 

If we are nearing the end of the sprint and there are still some tasks that are yet to be done. We as a team need to quickly work together and finish the unfinish taks. 

Using KANBAN helps our team alot, because we know our progress at any given time and we are able to adjust our behaviour accordingly.
