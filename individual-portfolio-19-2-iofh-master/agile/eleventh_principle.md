## The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
---
Our team uses this principle to help us make our project more successful. 


In the first few sprint, we assign specific task to specific members. For example, in the second and third sprint. I am assigned to do a more programming task while other team members are doing more of a designing task. 

This concept works for the first few sprints because the task is relatively easy. However, when tasks get harder. It doesn't scale really well. For example, one member might be doing database related stuff and the other might be doing controller related stuff. And once it's time to merge everything together. It might cause a lot of problems. For example, the controller calls the wrong database's table because of team members not communicating with each other.

Therefore, it is better to have the whole team to work together on a task. We learnt that through trail and error. We noticed that when things get more complicated, we need to change our approach when dealing with complicated task. We organized ourself and come up with a better way of dealing with complicated task. One example would be, me and Sen worked on the banning users' task together (side by side). This is because we know that if we did sperate things by ourself. Code conflict will happen and task would not get done efficiently.


    "Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. "

Instead of having the lecturers tell us how to divide task to individual members. We as a team come up with our own method to divide the task. We use the best method that we think will help the team and help the project grow.
