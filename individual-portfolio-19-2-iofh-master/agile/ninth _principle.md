## Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
---

To make our website more easy to develop, the lecturer taught us how to use the MVC framework. Using a well established design pattern we are able to build our website more easily. Instead of creating a new html for every webpage like what most websites were in the early 2000s. This gives evidence that we paid attention to technical excellence by using the MVC framework.

However, our project did not use this principle as much as we should. I only noticed it when i looked through our code. Most of our code is not reusable. Every method in our controller cant be reused. I think it is our inexperience with the laravel/php syntax, we just copy pasted older code and not understanding what each code does. 

With more experience with laravel/php i think our group would be able to write better code. It is difficult to be able to be fluent in php and laravel in just 1 semester. That is why i think we did not use this principle as much as we should. 

Technical excellence means that we need to write code that could be scalable. For example, following the object oriented programing rules. One method should only do one thing and we should reduce duplicate code. This will be the only way we can achieve technical excellence.
