## Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
---

Every two weeks we manage to deliver working software to our client and we notice that two weeks is just the right amount for us to finish our sprint backlog and deliver a working software to our client.

This [link](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-sw602/projects) shows the timestamp on when we create and finish our project. Most of our sprint was finished within 2 weeks time.

The reason for us to follow this agile principle is to make sure that we are making progress. As said in the agile principle __Working software is the primary measure of progress.__ And also we want to deliver a working software as fast as possible. So that our client could get the competitive edge.

This [article](https://www.anthonyregister.com/journal/2018/3/7/why-deliver-working-software-frequently-from-a-couple-of-weeks-to-a-couple-of-months-with-a-preference-to-the-shorter-timescale) helped me understand this agile principle.

Using this principle, our team are able to get

__More frequent customer feedback__ : We are able to make changes if the customer is not satisfied with it. We reduce the risk of doing what the customer don't want and ended up losing time and money.

__Faster time to market__: With shorter sprint, the customer give us feedback on what the current market wants. And we can adapt to those changes to meet the markets' needs, which in turn is what the customer want as well. With faster deployment, our customer can survive in the ever changing market.

__Return on Investment__: Our client are able to utilize the website as soon as we finish our sprint and after the customer reviewed it. With faster deployment, the customer can use our website to get the most value out of it.
