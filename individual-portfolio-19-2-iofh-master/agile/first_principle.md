## Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
---

After the first sprint, our team met with the client to show the result of our first sprint. The client is satisfied and gave us feedback immediately on what needs to be improved. For example, the website still allows unregister user to create, update and delete a game, we took notes and update it quickly in the next few days.

Having finished our first sprint and having a working website. The client can utilize our website in just 2 weeks time. Although there are not many features yet, more features will be added in the next few sprints.

On 2/09/2019, our team successfully push our product to the web. It is available for the customer to use. We will continue to deliver working software and deploy it after every sprint if possible.

Every sprint we met up with our client and show our client the result of that sprint. If the client did not like it, we will make some changes and if the client liked it then we will push it to our deployment server. We are able to get feedback straight away, when we have our face to face meeting.

We also used github and branches to seperate our developement branch from our deployment branch(master). 

Instead of waiting until the whole project to be completely finished and push it up to the deployment server, we push it up once every sprint. Because, through early and continuous delivery of working software, we allow the customer and the end user to use the website straight away and let our client gain a competitive advantage.

#### Analysis

According to [Marc Bless's blog](http://marcbless.blogspot.com/2011/03/agile-principle-1-satisfy-customer.html). 

"Highest Priority": it means that the our team should not be distracted and only focus on the important things. Which we did in our sprint. We only do what the customer wants. 

"satisfy the customer": we need to please our customer and give the customer what they want. We did this by creating user stories and letting the customer review it. And by the end of the sprint we met up with the client and show him the result of the sprint. If the customer is not satisfy with anything, we can always change it.

"early delivery": we want to give the result of our sprint to the customer as soon as posible. We did this by showing our client the project after our sprint ends. We also get feedback straight away during the meeting. 

"continuos delivery": we needed to show our result regularly. We fulfil this by showing our project to the customer every 2 weeks.

"valuable software": it means that our software must be valuable to our client. It might not be valuable to other people but as long as it is valuable to our client we are achieving this principle.
