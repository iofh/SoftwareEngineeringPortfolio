## Working software is the primary measure of progress.
---

Every sprint we manage to provide a working software for our customer to review.

However on our Sprint 2, nearing our meeting with the client. We did not have any working software. I managed to finish my search function on the website but my teammate Frederic could not get his part done in time.  In order to show working software. I helped Frederic by coding the functionality together with him.

Another time i help Frederic with coding is on the 4th sprint. We are supposed to make a CRUD for groups for our client. But Frederic did not manage to produce the functionality in time for our client. Therefore, i had to step in and help him in order to fulfil this agile principle. 

The code that i help Frederic with was [the score functionality](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-sw602/commit/f4a04f4ed7fa2121f814afdb4d0d1e5c38725016) and [the group functionality](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-sw602/commit/2d830d1cc8cd8b9ef3fa5bc4d814219e858688ec).  


As said in the agile manifesto, __working software over comprehensive documentation__. We as a team value working software and i wanted to make that a top priority for our project.

    "Working software is the measure of progress because there's no other way of capturing the subtleties of the
    requirements: Documents and diagrams are too abstract to let the user 'kick the tires,'" says Dave Thomas,
    coauthor of The Pragmatic Programmer (Addison-Wesley, 1999).

One situation in our project relates to the quote above. Our client wanted to know how our database tables are linked together. However, we politely told our client that we will only show a draft of our database diagram. And we will focus more on creating the working database to show him instead of spending our time designing sometime that might be change in the future.
