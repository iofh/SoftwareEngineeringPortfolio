# Third Sprint

## What went well
I managed to get most of the task done, which is to create/update/delete score function. However, not much work is done in this sprint which i am disappointed in me about. 

I learnt more on how to use migration script through reading the [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/migrations).

I also used git branches to help me with my development in the project. 

## What needs to be improved

#### Time management
I only take on the create/update/delete score function which isn't much. I did my task in the second week of the sprint. I could start it in the first week. However, i do have an assignment for linux that i need to finish up before the due date. 

Therefore, i couldn't start my task early and this leads to less work done on our project.

#### Taking on less than i can handle
I could take on more task if there isn't the linux assignment coming up. I only did the minimum of making the CRUD for scores. I do not think it is sufficient for our project to succeed in the long run by just doing basic task. I would need to take on more task in the next sprint and increase the velocity of our project.

#### Trusting my teammates
Due to the previous, i helped Frederic a lot in his task and i felt unfair for me to do most of his task and let him take the credit. So i assign him an easier task for this sprint. 

By doing that, i risk the problem of him not improving his web programming skills and ultimately will slow us down. So i need to trust my teammates more and assign them a more challenging task so they could improve. And i should help them up when they needed the help. This way, i could help them improve and also improve our project. Because when they are able to do difficult task, we can take on more challenging task and improve of our project even more.

## What lesson did i learn

#### Assigning the right amount of task for myself and my teammates

For our second sprint, due to the short sprint time of 8 to 10 days. We got too much task to do in a short amount of time. 

For that reason, i decided to assign less task for our third sprint. The sprint is still within the customer needs. It's just that we will not do extra things for the customer. 

Every member of our team takes the linux paper, so we all have the linux assignment. So i thought i would be best if we kept our task as minimum as possible  but is still within the customer needs.

But for the next sprint. I need to assign an amount that is just sufficient for us to achieve.


#### Using git branch to help us with development

Using git branches means that everyone could work on our master code and add it on later. Using branch will help reduce the risk of messing up the master branch code. The are many resources that i went through to find out why using branches is a good thing.

## What barriers did i encounter

#### Button using the same modal 

The modal for delete button in the game.show blade.

![Modal for the Delete Button](https://softenop.github.io/individual-portfolio-19-2-iofh/photo/thirdSprint/UsingDifModal.PNG)

Initially, i tried using this way to delete the score

![Multiple delete button](https://softenop.github.io/individual-portfolio-19-2-iofh/photo/thirdSprint/MultiDeleteButton.PNG)

Unfortunately, when i press delete, it deletes the score first score. I works with just one score, but with multiple scores, it deletes the wrong one. 

After asking martin for help with doing some javascript i still did not manage to do it. I decided to use another method which is putting the "Read More" similar to the view all games 

![Read more](https://softenop.github.io/individual-portfolio-19-2-iofh/photo/thirdSprint/readMore.PNG)

Which is easier than letting the score and games delete button use the same modal which messes up everything.
Although is not the best way to do it, it is best to produce a working software for the customer. 

Other than that, no other barrier is encountered.
