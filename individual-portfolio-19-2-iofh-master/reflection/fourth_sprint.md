# Fourth Sprint

## What went well
We had 3 weeks to do our task for this sprint. I manage to finish my task within the first 2 weeks. Everything decently well. However, Fredric and Alister did not manage to finish all their tasks on time.

I also assigned appropriate amount of work to each group members. However, there are some group members that has not finish their individual task. I would assume that they have problem with their time management. Because i account for what they did in the previous sprint and the task they were given were relatively easy enough for them. I think it might be because it is during the holidays and they might not be working on our project during the holidays.

## What needs to be improved

#### Designing/Bootstrap 

I am still not fluent in the bootstrap formatting. I wasted a lot of time doing html formatting which is not a good thing in my opinion. I needed to be more fluent at bootstrap so that i will not spend too much time finding the right class/id of bootstrap to format the website.

I also need to improve my sense in design. I tend to have a mindset of "if it works it works". But i should change my mindset so that i could be more agile. By doing things the right way.


#### Not helping my teammate as much
For this sprint, i did not help my teammate as much as the previous sprint. 

There is multiple reasons why i could not help my teammates. 
 - Other paper's assignment pilling up (Programming 4 & Networking)
 - Letting my teammates learn by themselve instead of me having to help them every time they see an error.

I wanted to let my teammates figure things out by themselves, since we are nearing the end of our project. However, i notice that once my teammate got stuck they got stuck for a few days which is not good for getting our website done. 

## What lesson did i learn

#### Checking up with teammates

Following what i mention up top, i learnt that i should constantly check up with my teammates and see whether they are stuck or not. Or else it will slow down our progress.

## What barriers did i encounter

The only barrier i encounter is getting the idea of how to ban/disable a user using a database table. After talking with some of the other groups and Martin. I manage to come up with a ban table where the user that has been voted to be ban will be in the table, and once the count is more than 2 then the user will be ban. 

![Function for ban user](https://softenop.github.io/individual-portfolio-19-2-iofh/photo/fourth_sprint/banning_function.PNG) Unbanning users' function

The function changes the user table's status field to 0 which bans the user. When the user is unbanned then the status changes back to 1.

I also found a youtube video which helped me of when i am trying to override the laravel checking credentials function. 

![Override login function with status to check whether user is ban or not ](https://softenop.github.io/individual-portfolio-19-2-iofh/photo/fourth_sprint/override_login_function.PNG)

The picture above shows the overridden credentials function. It checks for the user's status. 0 means the user is disabled and 2 means the user is active.



Other than that, I manage to do everything without much difficulty.
